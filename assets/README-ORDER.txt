BG order (front to behind):

BG- OpponentSide
BG- Border texture + Mask 
BG- Border
BG- Dust Texture (maskable, the dimension of the texture 
extends past the game border)
BG- Base (this is also the game resolution// i made it bigger)


Planets: 

These aren't all the variations, but enough for your demos for now.

Each planets size (big medium small) has its own lighting key. 

- Clip the light to the planet
- Rotate the planet pretty SLOWLY
- Lighiting layer is set to colour dodge
- Lighting should not rotate
- The other edge of the lighting later should be perfectly flesh with the edge of the planet (its already a perfect mask for simplicities sake.)

Mini Neptune - Med
Terrestrial - Med
Gas Giant - Big
Dwarf - small
Neutron star - N/a

Select glow goes behind the planet, blending Linear Dodge (Add)

Mass indicator also does behind the player (no blenind mode necessary)

Projectiles: No blending mode

Astroid belt forward is loopable
Astroid belt back is stationary
